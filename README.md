# UI Projects

All assets are free online. Had to mix and match some so it might not all look cohessive but the functionality is there.

- Main Menu 1 - Forest Theme
  - Had issues with the button displaying a white border around the asset but fixed by changing it to box instead of rounded box. Changed the image asset to UI to fix scaling

- Main Menu 2 - Dark Theme
  - Had issues with the border being stretched or deformed. Figured out a good margin. Set the asset image to UI and nomipmap. Played around with text animation with scale and color

- Interaction Prompt
  - Interaction pop up near interactable objects. UI button appears and faces the player always. Uses a sphere colider to display the button when the player is in the collision and makes it disappear when they are outside of it.

- Item Interaction Pick Up Player HUD and Inventory
  - Player is able to pick up items. Items are highlighted with an outline when they are interactable. The items also use the interaction prompt in the previous video. Items are added to the player inventory currently displayed on the player hud for simplicity. I've set an item limit for each item. 3 for lightning. 2 for shield. Ignore the names and images, just using free stuff and whats available on me. Added a slide on notification when picking up an item. Current issues with the prompt staying one time after limit is reached for every item of that type. Has something to do with the sphere collision on overlap.

- Health Systemm and Player HUD Health Bar
  - Player is damaged by fire and can pick up medkits (the target assets) to heal. Player health bar is displayed on the player hud top left. I may need to tweak the colors, but I wanted to use a nice asset instead of a simple bar. I also want to change the color depending on how low the health is and add an animation of how much the player got hurt with a red bar. Still using the Master Item class for medkits but tweakingn ismaxlimit to fit in the health sense.
