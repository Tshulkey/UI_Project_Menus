# UI Projects

All assets are free online. Had to mix and match some so it might not all look cohessive but the functionality is there.

- Main Menu 1 - Forest Theme
  - Had issues with the button displaying a white border around the asset but fixed by changing it to box instead of rounded box. Changed the image asset to UI to fix scaling

- Main Menu 2 - Dark Theme
  - Had issues with the border being stretched or deformed. Figured out a good margin. Set the asset image to UI and nomipmap. Played around with text animation with scale and color

- Interaction Prompt
  - Interaction pop up near interactable objects. UI button appears and faces the player always. Uses a sphere colider to display the button when the player is in the collision and makes it disappear when they are outside of it.
